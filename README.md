# 🎮 Pac-Man: The Yellow Circle's Revenge

A totally legitimate and definitely not copyright-infringing Pac-Man game in Java! 🟡

## 🎯 What's This?

It's Pac-Man, but coded by someone who probably had too much coffee. Navigate a maze, munch dots, and run from colorful ghosts who are definitely not having an existential crisis.

## 🕹️ How to Not Die

1. **Arrow Keys** - Move the hungry yellow circle around
2. **Eat Dots** - They're white, they're tasty, they give you points
3. **Avoid Ghosts** - They're colorful, they're spooky, they end your existence
4. **Don't Panic** - When you inevitably get caught anyway

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Compile (cross your fingers)
javac src/*.java

# Run (pray to the Java gods)
java -cp src app
```

## 📊 Game Stats

- **Lives**: 3 (spoiler: you'll need them all)
- **Score**: 10 points per dot (big spender!)
- **Ghosts**: 4 (because 3 wasn't enough suffering)
- **Fun Level**: Over 9000! cause it is single level game🔥

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | What Happens |
|-----|-------------|
| ↑ ↓ ← → | Move (rocket science, I know) |
| Any Key | Start/Restart (when life gives you game over...) |

## 🏆 Pro Tips

- Moving is generally better than not moving
- Ghosts are not your friends (shocking revelation)
- Walls are solid (who knew?)
- Points make the score go up (mathematics!)

## 🐛 "Features"

- Ghosts with the intelligence of a confused goldfish
- Collision detection that actually works (most of the time)
- Graphics from the golden age of pixel art
- Sound effects: *none* (use your imagination!)

## 🤓 Tech Stuff

Built with Java Swing because we're fancy like that. Runs at a blazing 20 FPS - your eyes won't know what hit them!
